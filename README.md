# 🌊 Subnautican Adventures — Underwater Arcade Survival Game

Subnautican Adventures is a fast-paced 2D underwater arcade game built using Unity (C#).
You control a submarine navigating through dangerous ocean life — sharks, octopuses, bombs, and other obstacles — while trying to survive as long as possible and score the highest!

Inspired by the simplicity of Flappy Bird, this project introduces a fresh underwater twist, immersive visuals, and smooth, responsive gameplay.
